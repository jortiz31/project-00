## Technologies Used

-jQuery

-Javascript Object Oriented Programming

-Bootstrap and custom CSS

## Existing Features

-Moves on unique key up (X and > arrow)

-alerts a winner

## Planned Features

-I plan to clean the code, as it was very difficult for me to implement OOP to make the application work as I wanted it to, I would have rather coded this project using standard jQuery and Javascript practices. As my OOP skills aren't where I want them to be (as of yet). Enjoy the game!
